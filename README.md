# hello-world
This is my first repository. I'm learning how to use Github!

Hello, everyone!

My name is Dalia.
Aside from Github, I am also learning how to play guitar.
I enjoy it very much.
The song I'm practicing at the moment is "Piledriver Waltz" by Arctic Monkeys.
Two years ago, I told my friend I would learn an Arctic Monkeys song and serenade it to them.
I don't want to break my promise.
